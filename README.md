#Full-Stack-Portfolio

##Description

This is my personal portfolio that will be used and updated throughout the BCS bootcamp. My portfolio will be the main foundation for which employeers can view my professional and educational experience when selecting future employees. Due to this, my portfolio must be presentable for any employeer or individual. Therefore; my portfolio displays an about me section to get a grasp of who I am, it shows my projects that I have worked on throughout the BCS course so far, and it has links to my github account and LinkedIn profile for more information. Over the course of working on this assignment, I have learned better practices for displaying content in a flex and grid display and the importance of CSS when it comes to showing a user critical information a developer would need to point out.

CSS sheets have the semantic structure applied and comments in the CSS stylesheet for better readability.
